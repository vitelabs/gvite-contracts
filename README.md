# soliditypp-devtools

This repository contains a local solidity++ development environment and a CLI tool for smart contract compilation and deployment. It also includes a few examples of smart contract written in solidity++.

For more details about deploying a local testnet to debug your smart contracts, please visit [Contract Debugging Tutorial](https://vite.wiki/tutorial/contract/debug.html).

# soliditypp-vscode

We recommend to use VsCode (with soliditypp extension installed) to deploy and debug your solidity++ smart contract. For more information, please refer to [Solidity++ Extension for VsCode](https://github.com/vitelabs/soliditypp-vscode).
